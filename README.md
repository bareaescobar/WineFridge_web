# Smart Wine Fridge Web UI

A modern web interface for managing your smart wine fridge.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- pnpm package manager (recommended)
- npm (alternative)

## Technology Stack

- Build tool: Vite
- UI Components: Swiper
- Package manager: pnpm (recommended) / npm
- Code Formatting: Prettier

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andriyl/smart-wine-fridge_web.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

## Development

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

### Previewing Production Build

```bash
pnpm preview
# or
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build locally for testing.

## Code Style and Formatting

The project uses Prettier for code formatting. You can:

- Check formatting:
```bash
pnpm format:check
# or
npm run format:check
```

- Automatically format code:
```bash
pnpm format
# or
npm run format
```

## Deployment

The application is built using Vite and can be deployed to any static hosting service. After building with `npm run build`, the contents of the `dist` directory can be deployed.
